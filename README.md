## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I play?
Tap on positive words (like "Joy," "Love," "Hope") while avoiding negative or neutral words. Find all positive words before the timer runs out!

### How is the score calculated?
Your score is based on:
- **Words found** — 100 points each
- **Speed bonus** — Up to 1000 points for finishing quickly
- **Speed multiplier** — Finish faster to multiply your entire score (up to 2x!)
- **Perfect bonus** — 500 points for finding all words with no mistakes
- **Penalties** — -75 points per wrong tap

### Can I reset my high scores?
Currently, high scores are stored locally on your device. Deleting and reinstalling the app will reset all scores.

### Is my data collected?
No. Positivity Tap does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Everything stays on your device.
